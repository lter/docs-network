It is accessible by any LTER information manager, but will probably be most actively updated by the LTER Network Office and the LTER IMExec Team. All LTER Information Managers will want to “watch” the repo for updates or check back regularly. To view the source code for any of these pages, see here.\nFor procedures on making edits to the manual, please see CONTRIBUTING.md."
