Each site has different audiences to prioritize and is situated differently within its home institution (or within a group of institutions and partners). However, maintaining some consistency across sites allows NSF, reviewers, and colleagues to easily find the information that is important to them. To achieve this balance, the network developed and approved a set of Content Guidelines for LTER websites. Please refer to these guidelines when developing new sites and updating existing websites."

    "text": "Platforms\nExactly how you go about creating or maintaining your site’s website depends on the legacy of the existing website (if any), what resources are available to you at your institution, how much your site has budgeted for website work, and what your site needs from your website. Some of the more common options across sites are listed below, as well as one new and interesting option.\n\nDrupal and DEIMS\nDrupal is an open-source content management system for building and maintaining websites. Several LTER sites use Drupal, and some of them joined forces to create DEIMS (the Drupal Ecological Information Management System, depending on whom you ask), a Drupal-based website solution which handles functionality common across LTER sites such as data catalog, bibliography, and personnel lists.\nDEIMS was developed in Drupal 7 and upgrade instructions to Drupal 8/9 can be found in a GitHub repository. Drupal manages information in a database, and modules have been developed to import and export ecological metadata language (EML) documents. Developing a new website in Drupal is more complex than, e.g., WordPress, but offers more opportunities for customization. However, IM supporting developments at EDI and the IMC have been replacing most functionality Drupal has been lauded for. If you already use DEIMS or are familiar with Drupal reach out to the IMs at these sites to learn more: NTL, KNZ, PIE.\n\n\nWordPress\nMany sites use WordPress for its ease of migration and editing. However, a DEIMS-like solution doesn’t exist for WordPress, so you will have to find a way to support interactive features such as a data catalog. Reach out to the IMs at these sites to learn more: VCR, CAP, JRN.\n\n\nStatic Website\nThere are many advantages to static websites. For example, you can typically find a free host for a static website, they’re secure, and they can be blazingly fast. While static websites used to be just for geeks, content management systems are evolving which make the editing experience more similar to WordPress or Drupal. By harnessing the power of online services and APIs, static sites can include interactive features like data catalogs and bibliographies. Reach out to the IMs at these sites to learn more: BLE, SBC.\n\n\nDataONE Portal\nFor a relatively new paid option with simpler sites, you may be interested in DataONE Portals. From DataONE:\n\nA portal is a collection of DataONE member node data packages on a unique webpage.\n\nIn other words, you can describe your project on your own portal page, and you can have a complete data catalog as long as all of your datasets are discoverable within DataONE. If you need other fancy features though, you may need to look elsewhere."

Thus, an individual may appear in multiple rows with different roles. Within each sheet, records are sorted first by “Current” or “Former” status and then alphabetically by last name. Be aware that the same individual may have both current and former affiliations, or may have multiple current affiliations.\n\n\n\nColumns\n\nDatabase Keys:\n\nA. Affiliation ID (protected): The unique key for the specific affiliation (role-site/institution-individual combination)\nB. Contact ID (protected): The unique key for the individual contact associated with that affiliation\nC. Account ID (protected): The unique key for the account (site or institution) associated with that affiliation\nD. Profile ID (protected): The unique key for the user associated with that affiliation\n\nSite Information:\n\nE. Acronym: The 3-letter site acronym. This should always match the spreadsheet tab in which you are editing. If an affiliation with a different site needs to be created or edited, that should be done by the individual or by the designated editor for that site.\n\nContact-related information:\n\nF. Last Name: Last name of the individual contact. Text fields can accept both hyphenated and un-hyphenated names. Special characters may be used with caution, but HTML formatting is not permitted.\nG. First Name: First name of the individual contact\n\nH. Middle Name: Middle name or initial of the individual contact (if known). If initials are used, please include a period.\nI. Email: Active email address of the individual contact. Be cautious in changing this. It also serves as the user’s login and (especially for former site participants) you may not have the most current information.\n\nJ. ORCID: Once entered, this is unlikely to change. Users will be prompted to update ORCIDs on site registration.\nP. Contact-Site ID: If your site uses a unique identifier for individuals that could aid in matching site and network-level information, this is the place to enter it. If you do not use such a system, please leave this field blank. Located at the end as only a few sites use this field.\n\nAffiliation-related information:\n\nK. Role (Affiliation): Recall that participants may have multiple simultaneous affiliations. This field holds the role for one affiliation with a particular site. The (limited) choices for this field are available in the drop down. Please DO NOT add choices that do not appear in the drop down selector. Options for “Role” are detailed later on this page.\nL. Start Year (Affiliation): The year that this affiliation started - to the best of your knowledge. This information is not strictly required and participants can update this information directly when they register on the site.\nM. End Year (Affiliation): The year that this affiliation ended - to the best of your knowledge. This information is not strictly required and participants can update this information directly when they register on the site. When an entered end year is less than the current year, the affiliation status will be automatically converted to “Former” at the time data is uploaded.\nN. Status (Affiliation): Status” has 2 options: “Current” or “Former.” This reflects an individual’s affiliation with the site. All newly affiliated individuals should be listed as “Current.” When an individual leaves your site, they should be identified as “Former” for your site and an end date entered for their role. When their status changes to “Former” at all sites with which they had an affiliation, their LTER status will automatically change to “Inactive”. As long as they maintain an active affiliation with any LTER site, their LTER status will be “Active.” This field controls whether individuals appear in the site directory for the affiliated site.\nO. Primary (Affiliation): This Boolean field identifies this affiliation as the primary one (across all LTER associations) for the associated individual. In general, it should be set by the individual during the registration process. Among several possible affiliations, it will usually be the most active or the most recent.\n\nUser-related information:\n\nQ. Active User?: This field contains a Boolean (true/false) value indicting whether a user has been activated for this contact.\n\nUpload/Update results columns: Columns S and beyond are used to store the result of the most recent uploads to SalesForce. Failures may indicate duplicate names or other conditions that require investigation. They should not be edited except by the LNO."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Updated June 2025\nAs LTER graduate student representatives, we are expected to fulfill specific duties to provide graduate students with the information, opportunities, and representation necessary to work successfully at each site. Since each site is unique, duties and responsibilities will differ, but certain duties should be fulfilled across sites.\nBelow is a list of duties and descriptions that every graduate student representative should aspire to fulfill. Certain items may not be relevant to all sites or graduate student representatives.\n\nGraduate student representatives are encouraged to attend executive committee meetings for their site. We understand that each site is different, but as graduate student representatives we believe that we should have the opportunity to have direct conversations with the Executive Committee of our sites.\nCreate a staff-grad student liaison that acts as a middle person between graduate student representative and site director(s). The staff liaison could be the head field/lab tech for a site, site coordinator, or safety manager. This is not a requirement for all sites but could be useful at sites where there is little or no direct interaction between the graduate student representative and the site directors.\nGraduate student representatives should be in touch with graduate students at their site so that they are aware of any issues that need to get addressed. This could be done by:\n\nLeading a site-specific climate survey once a year (ideally at the end of the field season, if applicable) to gauge how graduate students involved in the LTER feel about the current state of the site. A climate survey will be provided if this is the preferred method of communication. The results of the climate survey will be shared with the site director(s) to address any concerns at the site as well as the LTER GSC as a whole (when applicable).\nEncouraging students at their sites to fill out any network-wide surveys that the LTER distributes.\nRegular graduate student meetings or graduate student social events (anything that allows for regular communication between graduate students and the site representative).\n\nIf not already being managed by another person (such as an IM or administrator), the graduate student representatives should manage and update the site-specific grad student listserv (and other site communication channels) to make sure contacts are up-to-date. When the list is managed by another person, the graduate student representative should still be in communication with them to make sure the list stays current.\nGraduate student representatives should communicate GSC meeting notes (can send link to notes document) and/or highlights to graduate students at each site so that all LTER-affiliated graduate students are aware of network-wide information and the presence of the GSC.\nDuring the site’s All-Hands-Meetings (or another applicable time, if a site does not have one), graduate student representatives should facilitate a graduate student session/social. If applicable, the graduate student representative will also manage other site-specific student needs such as managing visiting student housing.\nNew graduate student representatives will attend an orientation meeting with the GSC co-chairs and should familiarize themselves with the GSC orientation package, which consists of 1) orientation checklist document, 2) orientation to GSC document, 3) graduate student representative duties document (this document), and 4) GSC by-laws document.\nGraduate student representatives will join one of the GSC working groups. Currently, the working groups are: community (works on GSC documentation), social media (manages the Instagram and SSALTER blog), and events and initiatives (coordinates network-wide graduate student events).\nSome sites have two graduate students serving as co-representatives, an option that is open to all sites. This can be useful in multiple situations, such as one in which there are two primary institutions with many students/scientists at the site, or many institutions that are geographically spread out. It may be convenient to have one rep who lives near the site who is responsible for “site-specific” tasks (e.g., organizing in-person events or workshops with students) and another rep who lives farther away and is responsible for “network-specific” tasks (e.g., attending monthly GSC meetings and participating in working groups). You may also opt to have a co-rep during a transition period (however long you choose) so that the old rep can train the new one before stepping down. Whatever you decide, you should keep the co-chairs updated on your situation.\nEach graduate student representative will coordinate one SSALTER blog post per academic year for their site. During the summer, they will identify at least one student who is willing and able to write the post in the upcoming fall or spring semester. Representatives are responsible for maintaining communication and ensuring the post is completed."

    "text": "Updated May 2024\n\n\nThe Graduate Student Committee respectfully acknowledges that the LTER Network Office sits on the land of the Chumash People. We also acknowledge that the LTER Network spans the lands of numerous tribes, and we encourage our members to recognize and engage with this information to learn about the continuous importance of both the land and water of Indigenous Peoples across time at their sites.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe LTER Graduate Student Committee (GSC) is an LTER network-wide standing committee as described in the LTER Bylaws Article VII, Section II (Revision 5.1, May 26, 2017). The GSC is a forum where graduate students from across the LTER sites work collectively to advance network-wide graduate student initiatives.\n\n\n\nThe LTER GSC provides leadership and coordination to support graduate student collaboration, funding, and inclusion by fostering graduate student networks within and between LTER sites. Graduate student representatives first and foremost act as the voice for other graduate students at their sites, and give graduate students at their sites the information, opportunities, and representation necessary to work successfully at each site. The GSC connects graduate students with the LTER Network Office (LNO) through sharing LNO news and updates at the site level. The GSC also strives to connect graduate students within sites, with site PIs/coordinators, and between LTER sites by organizing network-wide events to promote collaboration, professional development, research skills, etc. Furthermore, the GSC maintains conversation and collaboration with the Executive Board, BP Committee, and IM Committee. Within the GSC there are working groups, which currently include the Community working group (works on producing and revising GSC documents), Events and Initiatives working group (works on setting up network-wide events geared towards graduate students), and Social Media working group (works on outreach to the general public through the LTER Instagram and SSALTER blog). Overall, the GSC acts as a voice for LTER graduate students to promote graduate student success across the network.\n\n\n\nMembership includes one or two graduate representatives from each site who participate in a monthly committee-wide video conference. All graduate students at LTER sites are welcome to attend and participate in the LTER GSC monthly meetings, but non-representatives do not participate in GSC-wide votes.\n\nGraduate student representatives will serve a term of no more than 2 years and will find a replacement halfway through their second year. Term length may be shorter (no more than 1 year) for master’s students. Representatives will try, to the best of their ability, to find a replacement to start either in January or September depending on site field season. The process by which succeeding site representatives will be chosen is determined by each site. A period of one month minimum overlap is required between site representatives to facilitate continuity. Sites are responsible for submitting updated graduate representative contact info to the committee chairs each year. Graduate student representatives leaving their role are responsible for making sure their successor is invited to the Slack and Google Drive communication channels.\n\n\n\nElections and other committee-wide votes may occur in person at the triennial All Scientists’ Meeting or electronically through an online poll. Co-chair positions (always voted on, even if just confirmatory), committee representative positions (voted on if multiple people want the role), and documentation pertaining to the entire GSC such as the graduate student representative mission statement and goals, graduate student representative duties and GSC by-laws (this document) must be voted on. Documentation pertaining to the entire GSC will be revised by the Community working group and then sent out for a vote as detailed below.\n\nIn all cases, each site is entitled to a single vote, to be cast by the site representative or proxy. At least two-thirds of all sites must participate to constitute a quorum. For electronic votes, at least two thirds of all sites must cast a vote directly, by proxy, or via email to constitute a quorum. Voting outcomes are decided by majority vote (more than half). A runoff vote is necessary when a majority vote is not achieved. Votes held via an online poll will be open for a period of 7 days with a reminder 1 day before closing.\n\n\n\nCo-chairs Two site representatives will preside as LTER Graduate Representative Committee co-chairs. The term of the co-chair is two years. The terms of the co-chairs will be offset by one year for continuity. A new co-chair will be elected each year, with nominations in October, elections in November, one overlap meeting in December with the new and old co-chair, and the term officially beginning in January.\n\nCo-chairs supervise and coordinate the governance and communication of the GSC. They ensure communication occurs among GSC members as well as between the GSC and LTER boards, committees, and partners. The co-chairs will coordinate the communication of outcomes from graduate committee activities and events to the LNO and the GSC as necessary.\n\nExecutive and BP Committee Representatives. One graduate student representative will attend the LTER Executive Board meetings and another graduate student representative will attend the BP Committee meetings. The GSC rep sitting in on these meetings will attend them for 1 year before another grad rep is rotated into the role.\n\nThe expectation is that the GSC representative sitting in on the Executive Board and BP Committee meetings will:\n\nAttend all of the Executive Board/BP Committee meetings (1x month)\nReport back to the GSC on the monthly meetings\n\nAdd a brief written summary to the meeting notes for the next GSC meeting\nGive a brief verbal summary at the start of each GSC meeting during updates\n\nAdd agenda items to the Executive Board/BP Committee as needed, determined by the GSC as a whole.\n\n\n\n\nFunds can be requested from the LTER Network Office to support GSC activities and proposals. When funds are available, they will be used to support current LTER priorities such as synthesis activities and DEIJ initiatives. To access funds, site representatives must submit a proposal describing their proposed activities and budget to the LTER Network Office.\n\n\n\nThe LTER GSC is committed to fostering an environment that values diversity, multiculturalism, inclusion, and equity. The GSC will actively engage with the LTER community to embrace diversity and inclusion as part of our core values to develop a strong community network. The GSC strives to create a welcoming and inclusive environment by giving everyone the opportunity to contribute, including students from sites that are not graduate representatives. We will not tolerate microaggressions or actions that discriminate against marginalized communities (such as hate speech, misgendering, etc.). We are committed to making meetings and events accessible to all."

Today, research programs at 27 LTER sites support ecological discovery on the influence of long-term and large-scale phenomenon. LTER sites also serve the wider ecological community by:\n\nMaking more than 40 years of sustained observations publicly available\nDeveloping and maintaining large-scale experiments, which provide starting conditions for process-level studies and help to parameterize and test models for conditions that may not currently exist\nProviding long-term context and deep knowledge of place for researchers working on shorter-term projects training hundreds of graduate students in interdisciplinary and collaborative team science\n\nEach LTER site involves dozens of researchers, typically including microbial, community, and landscape ecologists, but also hydrologists, geochemists, social scientists, economists and even artists, historians, or philosophers. The shared knowledge of place offers unusual common ground for exploring disciplinary intersections.\nIf you are new to the LTER Network you can watch the LTER Network Orientation Video and check out the “New to the Network” web page.

    "text": "Maintaining a Site GitHub Organization\nOnce you’ve created a GitHub organization for your site, there are some ongoing maintenance tasks you may want to have on your radar.\n\nOrganization Teams\nGitHub organizations handle access to particular repositories via teams. Normally, to share a repository you invite particular users to a given repository from the settings page of that repository. In an organization context, you do the following:\n\nCreate a team\nAdd all relevant organization members to that team\n\nNote that they must be organization members beforehand\n\nAdd all relevant repositories to that team\n\nWhen you do this you can choose the level of access all team members have to that repository\n\n\nThis has a few distinct advantages relative to the non-organization method of sharing access.\n\nUsers gain access to team repositories without needing to accept a time-sensitive invite\nWhen you make a new repository that falls under the purview of an existing team, it takes one click from you to empower all members of the team to access that repository rather than requiring labor-intensive individual invites\nYou can still add users to specific repositories in the way you normally would!\n\nSo no lost functionality by embracing teams\n\n\nNote that only organization owners have the power to create teams or modify the level of access granted to existing teams. If a given research group has two or more repositories in the organization we recommend creating a team for that group to streamline access going forward. Consider the teams in the LTER Network GitHub organization as an example for how you might structure your site’s organization.\n\n\nTemplate Repository\nIt may be helpful to consider creating a template repository in your Organization so that researchers can easily embrace structural and documentation habits that make your life easier in the long run. For example, the Network Office created a template repository for synthesis working groups (see here) that includes a custom “.gitignore” file and some sub-headings in the README to prompt users to flesh out some valuable documentation early on.\nIn order to make a template repository, check the “Template repository” checkbox at the very top of a given repository’s “General” settings. When organization members create new repositories they can then choose this template instead of doing the typical manual approach to making a new repository.\n\n\nTable of Contents Repository\nFinally, we recommend creating a ‘table of contents’ repository when you create your site organization. It might seem excessive when you only have a handful of repositories but starting one early will make it easier to keep an eye on how repositories are organized within your organization (including repository naming conventions and use of GitHub topics)\nThe LTER Network organization index repository can be found here: github.com/lter/lter_github-index and is directly linked from our organization-level README to make it easier for visitors to find/use that index."

The IM Committee bylaws describe how the committee runs, how its leadership (IMExec) is chosen, and what the expectations are of its member IMs.\nWebsite Design and Content Guidelines lays out general guidelines for designing site websites. While each individual LTER site needs to fit into the structure of its parent organization(s) and uses different backend technology, all sites should maintain some common types of information.\nIM document archive: Based within the larger LTER document archive, the IM document repository holds current and historical versions of bylaws, annual meeting reports, working group reports and other information, which can be remarkably useful in understanding the context of the Network.\nEnvironmental Data Initiative: Once the data arm of the LTER Network Office, the Environmental Data Initiative is now LTER’s primary data partner and also serves a myriad of other NSF programs in Environmental Biology. In addition to data curation and infrastructure, EDI provides information management training, resources, and leadership in data harmonization for synthesis.\nRetired IM website (login: im / pw: lter): For several years, the LTER information management community maintained a website separate from the main lternet.edu website. With the advent of EDI and its broader community resources, much of the material maintained on the old im.lternet.edu website was moved to Environmental Data Initiative, while the LTER GitHub and Google drive supplanted the LTER-specific materials. A static copy of the old IM site is maintained here for reference, thanks to Sven Bohm."

Regular attendance at these “Virtual Watercoolers” is expected of all LTER information managers. Plus, it will really help you learn your way around the network, connect to colleagues, and stay painlessly up-to-date.\nIM Annual Meeting: Once a year, in summer or early fall, the entire group of information managers meets either in person or online to reconnect, move projects forward, and discuss new directions. These meetings usually take place in association with the LTER All Scientists Meeting or the meeting of a related society such as the Earth Science Information Partners or the Ecological Society of America. Reports from past annual meetings are found in the document archive.\nIM Committee on LTER Community Forum: Please join the LTER Community Forum and request to join the Information Managers Group and watch the Information Management category to take part in IM discussions and connect with colleagues.\nShared Google Drive: The LTER-committee-information-management google drive contains active working documents related to IM working groups, IM Exec, Committee Meetings, recordings of recent Virtual Water Coolers and other active resources. Once documents are finalized or working groups complete their activities, long term records move to the document archive. LTER Network Office Staff or current IM Exec members can add new LTER Information Managers to the shared google drive.\n\nLTER GitHub Organization: Many repositories house current and past programming projects of the LTER Network and its data partner, the Environmental Data Initiative. (Do start with the index, as there are a wide variety of projects in various stages of maintenance.) This manual is also maintained in a GitHub repo, where all LTER information managers can make suggestions for additions or updates."

    "text": "Zotero Updates\n\nSet up a Zotero account and a group library.\nDownload and install the Zotero desktop client and the browser add-on for the browser of your choice.\nTo facilitate sharing of publications that meet the criteria for inclusion in the Network bibliography, it’s helpful to add a “for the Network” collection. Collections operate like tags. There’s only one copy of the record – it just appears in multiple collections. So when you update it (with, say added tags or a print publication date), it is updated in all the collections within your library where it exists.\nImport your publications to your desktop Zotero client. Add a tag (LTER-XXX, where XXX= your site’s 3-letter acronym) to indicate which site(s) are associated with the publication. If it is a cross-site collaborative publication, do your best to add the tags for related sites, as well as the “cross-site” tag. If it is an information management-related publication, add LTER-IM and if it is an education-related publication, add LTER-EDU. Do your best with these, but they don’t have to be perfect. The LNO will also attend to adding necessary tags.\nAlways include a DOI for items when available. This can help identify duplicates when the LNO adds new items to a network-wide bibliography.\nSync your desktop client with your online group library.\nInvite the LNO staff (lternco@gmail.com) to your group library.\nIMPORTANT: When you do a significant update to your library, let the LNO know and we’ll drag the new publications from your library to the Network library and sync them so they appear in the LTER Network bibliography. There is not currently a way to autosync group libraries (which is probably a wise thing).\nAfter updating, the LNO will search for and resolve duplicates. The merge process adds all the tags that were associated with either of the duplicate publications to the resulting combined publication. For example: if Andrews Forest, and Harvard Forest each upload the same publication, marked with their own tags (LTER-AND and LTER-HFR), the merged publication will have both tags. This is a quick process for a few publications, but even so, it adds up for hundreds. If you can share with us when your last update occurred, it will help to focus the search.\n\n\nNotes on Item Types\nConference “papers” are a particular challenge. Juried conference papers (where a full paper results and is reviewed and published) should be added to Zotero as conference papers. Abstracts of meeting presentations (which don’t appear as papers) should be entered in Zotero under the “presentation” item type. NSF accepts presentations in annual project reports, but the LNO does not include them in the Network bibliography.\nFind full details on the definition of item types and the required and optional fields on the biblio fields page."

    "section": "Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)",
    "text": "Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\nQ: Do you have the publications from our most recent annual report?\n\nA: The LNO does not receive your annual reports to NSF. The LTER Network Office is not part of NSF and NSF has very strict rules about how they share information. The only way we would receive your annual report is if you send it to us.\n\nQ: Where did you get those most recent papers?\n\nA: The LNO has a Web of Science alert set up for all LTER grant numbers in funding acknowledgements. We get 30-50 hits per month on those (for all of LTER) and we add them to our Zotero library (tagged with the appropriate site) when they come in. That’s the source of the newer articles. This allows us to keep the Network bibliography reasonably current. Otherwise, we would always be a year or more out of date.\n\nQ: I see articles without dates or with only partial titles.\n\nA: Articles without dates probably were incomplete in the original file we received or they have only been published online (not yet in print) at the time we added them. When they come out in print, we generally receive a second alert, which we merge with the first.\n\nQ: Our site uses internal accession numbers to track our publications. Where should that go?\n\nA: Many other kinds of information can go in the “Extra” field in Zotero, including accession numbers. You may need to develop a specific export mapping if you maintain your site bibliography in a custom database.\n\nQ: Is there a way to track data that is associated with a publication?\n\nA: Yes! This too can go in the extra field. Be sure to include it on its own line. For additional information, see BLE’s Zotero Javascript Search Client Repo.\n\nQ: I like the LTER Network search client. Can I create something similar for my own site?\n\nA: That would be awesome. Find more information at LTER Network Zotero client Repo and BLE’s Zotero Javascript Search Client Repo\n\nQ: What’s the point of all this?\n\nA: Beyond simply reporting the products of LTER research, combining the LTER Network bibliography allows us to ask and answer questions about how network-wide synthesis happens. At least two big analyses have come out of the LTER Network bibliography\nCollaboration across Time and Space in the LTER Network. March 2020. Tian-Yuan Huang, Martha R Downs, Jun Ma, Bin Zhao.
