There are several separate areas of documentation described below.\n\nInformation Managers\nEvery LTER site has an “information manager”. These staff members are responsible for a variety of technical tasks at their respective sites, primarily centered around the management and archiving of the huge volumes of data produced by the long-term research performed at each site. Documents relevant to IMs can be found under the eponymous dropdown menu."

It does not aspire to be a single source of information and resources for information management more generally–nor even for the myriad best practices that have been established through IM collaboration in the LTER Network.\nAny LTER information manager may make edits to these pages, but it is likely to be most actively updated by the LTER Network Office and the LTER IM Executive Team. All LTER Information Managers will want to “watch” the repo for updates or check back regularly. To view the source code for any of these pages, see here. For specific procedures on making edits to the manual, please see CONTRIBUTING.md.\n\nWhat Do You Need to Do?\n\nI’m brand new to LTER\nI’m familiar with LTER, but a new Information Manager\nAsk for help with something\nUpdate my site’s personnel\nUpdate my site’s publications\nObtain a unique site identifier\nCreate (or edit) a site website\nWrite Ecological Markup Language (EML)\nEstablish a site GitHub Repository\nSuggest edits to the IM Manual"
