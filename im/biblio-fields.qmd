NSF uses a fairly narrow set of entry types for annual report and public access repository reporting. In general, it makes sense to align the LTER publication database with those types, but we are allowing a few additional types to accommodate technical reports, gray literature, and a miscellaneous type to accommodate awkward and unanticipated modes of publication, such as maps and software packages. The required fields for each entry type are the same as NSF's and are listed below the entry type.

- article - An article from a journal or magazine. 
    - Required fields: author, title, journal, year
    - Optional fields: volume, number, pages, month, note
