We welcome edits to the IM manual. You can make edits in a number of ways as described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/lter/docs-network/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you just want to post a suggestion or comment, the simplest approach is to sign in to GitHub and create an [issue](https://github.com/lter/docs-network/issues). Click the **New issue** button to get started.

You can use plain text to describe your issue, but if you want to take advantage of more advanced features, check out [GitHub's Quickstart guide](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/quickstart).
