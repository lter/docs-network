For general information management (IM) questions, check out the **`#im`** channel in the [LTER Slack workspace](https://lter.slack.com/).
Post your question, and you'll likely get a response from other IMs active that day.

For general LTER questions, again try [Slack](https://lter.slack.com/), or email director of the LTER Network Office (LNO) Marty Downs.

For help with archiving data at the Environmental Data Initiative, [email EDI](mailto:info@edirepository.org). Or join [EDI's Slack](https://edi-got-data.slack.com).
They are generally very responsive and helpful.

If you see something at an LTER site and you want to know how they did that, reach out to the IM.  We're a friendly community. Some are even eager to share because shared solutions can be more sustainable and it makes the site look good when reviews and renewals come up!
