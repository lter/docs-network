The leader(s) of each working group is expected to record notes in a meeting document and communicate to greater GSC if there are updates that need to be communicated to graduate students at all sites.

As of September 20205, the following working groups are active:

*  **Community Working Group**: ensures that committee documents are up to date and creates documentation when needed.

*  **Social Media Working Group**: facilitates digital media interactions between LTER sites by sharing experiences through managing a blog and overseeing the LTER Instagram account.

*  **Events & Initiatives Working Group**: develops and organizes events across the LTER network with a focus on meeting graduate student interests and needs.
