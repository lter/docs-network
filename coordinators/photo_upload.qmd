## LTER Photo Upload Guide
 
### Overview:

The Long Term Ecological Research Network operates in twenty-six incredible locations dispersed across the globe. The LTER Network Office relies on researchers and site personnel to capture photos that capture the beauty of these sites, as well as photos that show what kinds of activities occur at sites across the network. The Network Office runs a smugmug.com account that allows people across the network to upload, view, and download images associated with LTER sites.
 
The link to the smugmug account is: [https://lternetwork.smugmug.com/](https://lternetwork.smugmug.com/)
 
### Site Access:

The LTER SmugMug website is publicly visible. However, only users with upload links can upload photos to galleries. Uploaded photos are also publicly available to download.

### Photo Use Agreements:

Photos uploaded to the LTER SmugMug are made available for public use through the [CC By-SA 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en). This license lets others distribute, remix, tweak, and build upon your work (even commercially), as long as you are credited for the original creation. This is the most accommodating of licenses offered, and is recommended for maximum dissemination and use of licensed materials.

### Uploading photos:

The LTER Network Office encourages users to upload their own photos to each site’s respective gallery. We encourage users to upload photos that are unique, visually stunning, tell a unique story, or highlight research personnel in action. The Network Office has a low capacity for curating galleries, so we encourage users to be selective with their uploads. For example, select the best photo or two from a sequence of photos displaying an activity, or pick a great landscape or two from a day of work. However, we do rely on you to upload photos, so if you have a lot of great, unique photos, don’t hesitate to share them!
