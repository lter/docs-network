*Reporting on activities from May 2024-September 2025*

**Purpose:** The annual committee report informs the Executive Board and the PIs on committee activities and provides content for the committeeâ€™s webpage. 

**Presentation:** In 2025, committee reports will take place at a dedicated Lead PI Meeting on November 18, 2025, scheduled for 10-11:30 am PT. The executive board representative and/or committee chair(s) will have about 10 minutes to present and an additional 5 minutes for questions/discussion. The presentation may take whatever format you choose to communicate the committee's goals, activities, and concerns. Questions, issues or proposals that generate significant discussion at the meeting may become the focus of deeper discussion at Executive Board or Lead PI Meetings throughout the coming year.
