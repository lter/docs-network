This website is the living home for shareable documentation and policies for the LTER Network. For more information about LTER, see [lternet.edu](https://lternet.edu/). There are several separate areas of documentation described below.

### Information Managers

Every LTER site has an "information manager". These staff members are responsible for a variety of technical tasks at their respective sites, primarily centered around the management and archiving of the huge volumes of data produced by the long-term research performed at each site. Documents relevant to IMs can be found under the eponymous dropdown menu.
