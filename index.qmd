This website is the living home for shareable documentation and policies for the LTER Network. For more information about LTER, see [lternet.edu](https://lternet.edu/). There are several separate areas of documentation described below.

### [Information Managers](im/home.qmd) (IMs)

Every LTER site has an "information manager". These staff members are responsible for a variety of technical tasks at their respective sites, primarily centered around the management and archiving of the huge volumes of data produced by the long-term research performed at each site.

### [Principal Investigators](pi/home.qmd) (PI)

### [Education & Outreach Committee](edu/home.qmd) (EOC)

LTER recognizes the value of sustained interactions between students, teachers, and scientists, and strives to integrate LTER science with K-12 education. Most LTER sites conduct individual programs at the local level, and the network supports centralized approaches to educational initiatives where possible.
