# Documentation Website Contributing Guidelines

Edits to the website built by this repository can be made either directly through GitHub or via a local clone. Currently all members of the `network-office` and `info-managers` teams have the ability to make edits and triage issues in this repository.

## Documenting Changes

Please document all substantive edits in the [NEWS.md](https://github.com/lter/docs-network/blob/main/NEWS.md) file in the top level of this repository. High-level summaries of changes there will make the strategic summary of changes easier to track through time and will allow for more informative [GitHub release](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/about-releases) details.

## Minor Edits

When making minor edits, feel free to make those directly in the "main" branch.

## Major Edits

If making major edits--either to particular documents or to the structure of the website--please create a [branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches) for those edits and submit a pull request when you are ready to have those changes be reflected in the live website.
